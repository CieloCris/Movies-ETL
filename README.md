# Movies ETL Analysis

## Overview

In this project from Amazing Prime, we helped Britta to create an automated pipeline that takes new data, performs transformations, and loads data into SQL tables.

To accomplish our goal, we created four deliverables using Python, Pandas, NumPy, SQLAlchemy, Jupyter Notebook, Psycopy2, PostgreSQL, and PgAdmin.

We used functions, RegEx, and other **resources** to be able to perform an Extraction, Transformation, and Load (ETL) process working with CSV and JSON files:  wikipedia.movies.json, movies_metadata.csv, and ratings.csv. 

We can declared our final **purpose** was to create an ETL pipeline using Jupyter Notebook and PostgreSQL from raw data (from three files) to SQL tables.

## Results

We used the three-phase process-ETL (Extract, Transformation, and Load) to extract, clean, structure, transform, merge, export and create tables in a SQL format. We managed to achieve our goal by creating an automated pipeline with functions, filters, libraries, and regex in four deliverable files.

As a final result, we created two  SQL tables. The following image shows the movie table, which has 6,050 rows and 31 columns. It's important to mention that the original file had 7,311 rows.

The ratings table, which has 26,024,289 rows and 5 columns is showed below:

## Summary

The Extract, Transform, and Load process is very efficient for companies like Amazing Prime. 
However, this project was challenging because of its complexity. We even had problems with GitHub because of the larges files and also had issues understanding other topics, that is why We have to keep practicing.
